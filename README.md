# House-prices
Data Science project tp determine the price of the property. Using Demo prices.
Have you ever wanted to know how much an apartment or house costs to rent or own in your area? How do machine learning and statistics work with a powerful programming language like Python?

Machine learning is a major field that lets computers take in data and learn patterns to make predictions and decisions. We will be using Python to learn about one of the fundamentals of predictive modeling in machine learning and, more specifically, linear regression. To help us out, we will use a few data science libraries:

ðŸ”¢ NumPy offers a robust foundation for numerical operations and data analysis.
ðŸ“– Pandas lets you to analyze, clean, explore, and manipulate data from different sources.
ðŸ“ˆ Matplotlib transforms your data into compelling visuals like 2D graphs and bar charts.
ðŸ¤– Scikit-learn, commonly known as Sklearn, provides a user-friendly interface for all kinds of machine learning.

# Linear Regression
In statistics, linear regression is used to model relationships between independent x variables (e.g., house sizes) and a dependent y variable (e.g., house prices) by fitting a linear equation to observed data. Put simply, we are drawing a straight line through a dataset to map out and predict. In data science, linear regression is widely used for tasks such as predicting sales, analyzing economic trends, and understanding the impact of variables on an outcome.
